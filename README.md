# 🛡️ AI Legal Shield

**AI Legal Shield** is a machine learning project designed to distinguish between real and AI-generated legal case files using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. The project aims to address the growing concern of synthetic legal documents in the legal domain.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a classifier that can accurately differentiate between authentic legal case descriptions and those generated by AI (e.g., GPT-based models), thereby supporting legal authenticity checks and reducing misinformation in judiciary documents.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Real Case Files**: Collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) legal datasets.
- **AI-Generated Case Files**: Synthesized using GPT-4.
- Both datasets were converted from `.txt` files to a structured `.xlsx` format with columns like:
  - Serial No
  - Case Title
  - Court Name
  - Date of Judgment
  - Case Number
  - Case Description
- Final merged dataset includes a `label` column: `0 = Real`, `1 = AI-Generated`.

---

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

- Combined and cleaned both real and AI-generated files.
- Removed nulls, duplicates, and irrelevant metadata.
- Text normalization (lowercasing).
- Used only the **Case Description** (optionally with Case Title) for model training.
- Applied basic rule-based NLP (custom stopwords) to remove common legal boilerplate terms.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Extraction

Used **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
- `max_features=5000`
- `ngram_range=(1,2)`
- Custom stopwords (e.g., "court", "judgment", "state") to reduce noise.

---

## 🤖 Model Training

- Algorithm: **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation:
  - Stratified 70/30 Train-Test Split
  - **10-Fold Cross Validation** to verify generalization
  - ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix visualization
- Final Accuracy: ~99–100% (Tested on unseen data)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve plotted using Matplotlib + Seaborn.
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score reported.
- Evaluation metrics and plots saved in `/Model` folder.

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Implement deep learning models (LSTM/BERT) for semantic analysis.
- Build a web interface to allow users to upload case files and receive classification.
- Include more languages and court formats for broader applicability.
